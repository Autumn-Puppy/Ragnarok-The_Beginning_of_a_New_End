2,172,000,000 years after Jebadiah, Valentina, Bob and Bill first expored the cosmos Kerbals have mysteriously awoken yet again on a planet now called Odin. Since the 
time of Kerbin many things have happened to the Kerbol system, another solar system passed very close causeing many disruptions. 
Kerbin, now called odin is outside the habitable zone and is slowly freezing, only volcanic activity keeping a small belt of habitable temperature around the equator. 
The Kerbals must look to the skies once again to find a new home.

REQUIREMENTS:
Scatterer
Kopernicus

VERY WIP

Known Problems:
-Science is not balanced
-KSC is on weird spot
-Some planets are lacking on detail, Mimir is currently the most polished body
